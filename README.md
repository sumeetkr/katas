katas
=====

Katas originally were training methods for martial arts. But these Katas havae a different significance. 
They are there to train a programmer. These are programming puzzles/ algorith questions which you would like to solve 
agaain and again. 
I used test first approach for most of them, which helps me to practise TDD in addition to adding my algorithm 
develeopent skills.
