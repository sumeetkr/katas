katas
=====

Katas originally were training methods for martial arts. But these Katas havae a different significance. 
They are there to train a programmer. These are programming puzzles/ algorithm questions which you would like to solve 
again and again. 
I used test first approach for most of them, which helped me to practise TDD, in addition to learning new algorithms.

Language used: Mostly Ruby, otherwise C#.
